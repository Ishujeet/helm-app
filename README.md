# WordPress

[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) is one of the most versatile open source content management systems on the market. A publishing platform for building blogs and websites.

## TL;DR;

```console
$ helm install stable/wordpress
```

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.4+ with Beta APIs enabled
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
$ helm install --name my-release stable/wordpress
```

The command deploys WordPress on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```console
$ helm delete my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Persistence

Persistent Volume Claims are used to keep the data across deployments. This is known to work in GCE, AWS, and minikube.
See the [Configuration](#configuration) section to configure the PVC or to disable persistence.



## Ingress

This chart provides support for ingress resources. 

To enable ingress integration, please set `ingress.enabled` to `true`
